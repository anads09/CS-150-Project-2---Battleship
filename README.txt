A command line battleship game in which the user plays against a computer opponent that takes random shots, not shooting the same space more than once.

A near miss is when a shot lands next to, or digonal to a ship.

  !.. <-- That is a near miss because of the ship diagonal from it.
  
  .xo
  .o. <-- Those shots were regular misses because the ship on the x was destroyed before those shots were fired.
